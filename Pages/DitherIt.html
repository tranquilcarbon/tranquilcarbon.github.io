        <h1>What is Dither It?</h1>
        <p>Recently, I discovered a magazine by the name of <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low Tech Magazine</a>. It uses a server to host it's website. </p>
        <p>"So what?"" I hear you say. "Every website on the internet uses a server, or at least runs server software!"</p>
        <p>That is true, but servers use a lot of energy, And I'm interested in reducing my energy usage (reduce my bills, and my impact on the environment.)</p>
        <p>Low Tech Magazine is run through solar panels. Admittedly, the server is a Raspberry Pi and thus doesn't use much energy (And thus, a normal rack or tower server wouldn't work with it)</p>
        <p>There are many ways it reduces energy usage. For example, Pages are kept to a minimum. Fancy CSS, javascript and other mainstays are missing, to save power. And (Bringing this back to the topic at hand), Images are dithered.</p>
        <h2>Dithered?</h2>
        <p>Dithered is a technique to reduce the amount of colours without suddenly including new colours (Known as banding). It was most prevalent during the late 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Composite_image_demonstrating_dithering_effect.png" alt="A photo of a cat. There are 3 photos of the same cat. On the left is the original, in the middle is photo banding and on the right is dithering.">
        <p>Original image by Wapcaplet on Wikimedia Commons. Edited by Riumplus and used on Wikipedia Page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither">Dithering</a></p>
        <p>This cat photo demonstrates both colour banding and color dithering.</p>
        <p>On the left is the original. See that the cat's fur colour is smooth and cleanly moves from one shade to another.</p>
        <p>In the middle is banding. notice that the colours appear to suddenly stop.</p>
        <p>And on the right is dithering. It looks fairly similar to the original, but you can still tell.</p>
        <h2>Getting back on track</h2>
        <p>When you visit Low Tech Magazine, you'll notice that it's photos are dithered. This is because serving full colour depth images takes up more resources and thus more power.</p>
        <p>Instead, the colours are coloured monochrome (Black & White with 4 shades of gray in between for contrast).</p>
        <p>To do this, a application called Dither It! is used. You can find it's source code <a href="https://github.com/alexharris/ditherit-v2">Here</a></p>
        <h1>How to use Dither It!</h1>
        <p>Using Dither It! is fairly simple.</p>

        <p>To demonstrate this, we'll take this photo named "Today's Cat@2020-12-03", taken By Flickr User "masatsu" (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA 2.0 Deed</a>)</p>
        <img src="../Images/DitherIt/Step2.png" alt="A user interface depicting some colours automatically picked by the Dither It software.">
        <p>The website will automatically generate a palette using the most common colours in the image. If that's all you want, just click the "Dither" button.</p>
        <p>If you want to add a new colour, just click the plus button. If you want to edit a colour that was picked, click on said colour. A colour picker will appear. There are also several pre-made colour palettes. just below that is where you can export a palette you have made as well as import one.</p>
        <p>If you aren't getting the expected results, try playing around with the Dither Mode and Algorithm settings.</p>
        <p>Once you're finished, click the "Dither" button and click "Save"</p>
